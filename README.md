## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **Full-Stack TypeScript Monorepo**
```
synapse-monorepo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # React + TypeScript frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # Express + TypeScript backend
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ netlify.toml     # Serverless deployment configuration
```

### **Frontend Stack**
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript, built with Vite
- **UI Libraries**: ReactFlow (canvas), Recharts (analytics), Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Custom React hooks, TanStack Query, React Context
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication SDK

### **Backend Stack**
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express, serverless-compatible architecture
- **Authentication**: Firebase Admin SDK for secure token verification
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with custom controllers and services
- **Deployment**: Netlify Functions for serverless execution

### **Database Strategy**
